Dear Adrian,

It's been a while since we last talked and I am happy to write to you again.
I hope this message finds you ok, we wanted to let you know that we will be
leaving the country for a few weeks during our summer time holiday. Meanwhile,
our beloved cat Snowflake will remain home and we wanted to kindly ask you if
there is a chance to watch out for her while we are on vaccation.

There are a few things to take care of: please make sure to feed her twice
a day and don't forget to fill in her water tank. We will provide you with
the keys to our home and we will let you know where to find the food. Special
care must be taken when you start cleaning her litter box. Ideally if you have
time, this should be done daily.

Oh and I was about to forget: please verify our mailbox once per week as we
are subscribed to a monthly newsletter and we don't want to miss it while we 
are gone. Make sure to keep the windows closed while you leave the house to
prevent our cat from running away.

I hope to hear from you soon and thanks in advance for your help.
Lots of love,
Sebastian
