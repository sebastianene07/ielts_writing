Dear Sir/Madam,

I am currently enrolled in the third year at the college and I am studying
computer science with professor Quentin. The course takes place twice a week
with my class and we have laboratories for practice as well as slides
presentations. 

I am writing to request one week off this course as I am going to participate
to the Phisycs olympiad, where I am proudly to represent my college. The
contest will take place in another state and I am required to travel there.
The olympiad will last for five days and we will have to solve a bunch of
problems with different difficulties.

I would be grateful if you allow me to leave by the begging of Januarry. I will 
do my best to put me up to date with all the materials and the information
that were presented by Mr Quentin during my absence.

I am looking forward to hearing from you,

Yours faithfully,
Sebastian Ene
