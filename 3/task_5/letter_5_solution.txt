Dear Mihai,

Its been a while since we last talked and I wanted to let you know that
unfortunately I wouldn't be able to make it and arrive to you in Canada as
we planned.

Something unexpected happend in our familiy and I need to attend
to this event: Maya is getting married and she invited me to take part to 
her wedding. While we received this news with a lot of joy, it took us by
surpise and some people from my familiy couldn't attend because of the short
notice period.

I am terrible sorry that I have to postpone my visit and I will try to make
up to you. I wanted to ask you if delaying my visit with one month
will be ok with you schedule. How are things with you ? Is everything ok with
your job ? Please let me know if my visit will affect your work schedule,
I don't want to take your time.

I will be happy to receive a response from you whenver you have time.
Lots of love,
Sebastian
