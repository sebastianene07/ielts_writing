Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to you to complain about a situation which I am facing with
during my stay at our room college. I find it very difficult to live with
my roommate because we have some problems with the heating system and we
can't install an electric radiator. The sockets were simply not designed to
support such a high current load. Given this conditions, we are unable to
perform our work duties for the college.
Besides that, we have some other issues with the neighbours below us. There
were many times when we asked them to turn the music off during quiet hours
and they simply ignored us.
As these issues are stopping us from performing well during our classes, we are
kindly asking you to relocate us to a new room which is quiet and has the
heating system functional.

Yours faithfull,
Sebastian Ene
