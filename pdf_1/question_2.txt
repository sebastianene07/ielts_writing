Dear Mr Smith,

I am writing to you to complain about our stay in the apartment that we
rented from you. My name is Sebastian Ene and we both agreeed to sign up for
a long term accomodation contract that includes this year aswell. Given the
fact that we already stayed here for quite some time, we are asking you if
there is a posibility to upgrade our furniture.

As we are working from home most of the times, the furniture that we have
right now lacks accessibility and occupies a large amount of space. For
example, instead of placing a large couch inside the living-room, we can
reclaim that space and mount a standing desk. This will be very useful
because most of the times we are sitting on uncomfortable chairs.

We know that time is very important to you and you would do anything to
satisfy our needs. We created a list with the furniture that we would like to 
change and we kindly ask you if there is any possibility to review it and let
us know when it can be replaced.

Yours sincerely,
Sebastian Ene
