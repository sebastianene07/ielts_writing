Dear Sir/Madam,

I am studying Business English in the third year at the New Zeeland school
and I am writing to you to ask you for guidance. I was currently informed
from the school that the summer work placement programme has been cancelled
and this is unfortunate as it will impact my school performance and my
finance.

I think that the students from my grade are all afected by this and we will
likely have bad grades at the practice course because of this. Apart from that,
we will definitely find it harder to apply for a new job after we finish our
studies, because we don't have any work experience accumulated. Moreover,
working during summer time is a way for me to increase my savings and
to pay for the studies.

If you are kindly enough to help me with some information, I would like to
know if there is any possibility to work during summer time period in
another state. I would do my best to prepare myself in order to meet
the expected requirements for the job interview.

I am looking forward to hearing from you,
Yours faithfully,
Sebastian
