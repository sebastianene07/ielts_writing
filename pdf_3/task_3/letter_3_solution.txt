Dear Sir/Madam,

I am a client who rented your apartment about a month ago and I am writing to
let you know about a refund that I requested from you. As we agreed in the 
contract terms, I had to pay in advance a deposit which has to be refunded
once the contract expires. The given conditions were that this amount of 
money will be returned entirely if the flat is returned in a good shape(without
any damage to the home equipment or other components).

I kindly ask you to respect our agreement and to return the initial deposit
that I payed to you. We had a very good colaboration and I will definetely
recommend your location if my request is fulfilled.

I am open to follow any kind of legal action and to inform my lawyer in case
our relation doesn't continue on the amiable path, but I am pretty sure that
this will not be the case. If the money will be payed back in thirty days,
everything will be according to the contract and no legal action will be
involved.

I am looking forward to hearing from you,
Yours faithfully,
Sebastian
