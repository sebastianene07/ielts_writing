Dear Sir/Madam,

I am a client that rented an apartment through your agency about a year
ago. The apartment is located in Kensigton square and it is a one bedroom
flat located at the second floor.

I am writing this letter to apologize for the inconvience but we wanted
to inform you that we wish to terminate contract earlier as something
unexpected happened in our familiy and we have to move back in our country.
Our initial agreement was to rent this flat for one year but we will have to
leave two months before the stated date.

We regret to inform you about our decision but the problem that we are facing
can't wait to be solved. One of our parents needs special medical care and
needs to be assisted as it is going to have a surgery. Because of this we
will have to return to our country to keep an eye on them.

If it's possible we would like to stay in touch with your services as we were
very happy to colaborate with your agency.

Yours faithfully,
Sebastian Ene
