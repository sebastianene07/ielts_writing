Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you to express my interest about an article that was published
by your newspaper which informs us that our beloved park will no longer be
in the property of the city council. I have a subscription to your
newspaper by the name of Sebastian and I am one of the readers who promote
the articles that your journalist create.

I was very dissapointed to receive the news about the park beeing sold to a
private real estate investor and I wanted to explain to you the importance 
of this park for the people leaving nearby. This green corner is one of the
few relaxation spots from our neighbourhood and it gives us the possibility
to take our children out for the playground. Apart from that, it is a
shelter for all the birds and the local fauna and building apartments here
will destroy our biodervisty.

If there will be no action taken by the mayor to stop this illegal transaction,
I will discuss this issue in our local community and we will start a protest
against it.


Yours faithfully,
Sebastian
